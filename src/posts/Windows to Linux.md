I've used Windows my whole life.

The first computer I remember ever seeing was my parents beige CRT Monitor + Tower combo that sat idley in my childhood living room. I remember the whirring and clicking sounds of it starting, the red flashing LED light, and the friendly familarity of the [windows xp boot sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nQ2oiVqKHw).

However, in the last month or so I've been using Ubuntu Linux at home and, suprisingly, I don't miss Windows at all. In fact, I'd even make the arguement that, for my use case, Linux is a way better fit.

### Why I Switched in the first place

When I was a teenager there wasnt anything I wanted more than a gaming PC. I helped one of my best friends build on one and was hooked from then on.

### Why I think Im going to stay

There are 4 main reasons that contribute to my reasoning for staying on linux for good this time. They are as follows :

#### #1 : Better Developer Experience

#### #2 : Games work Great

#### #3 : Free and Open Source!

#### #4 : It feels familiar
