### Hey! Thanks for checking out my new website!

I've been working on it over the past while and am hoping it will act as a sort of homebase for my interest in Technology, Development, and a few of my other interests.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'React';

export default class HelloWorld extends Component {
  render() {
    return <p> Hello World! </p>;
  }
}
```
