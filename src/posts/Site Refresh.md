### Why I Refreshed My Website

I refreshed my website for a few reasons...

The previous version of this website was a very basic, poorly designed, react app. It wasn't at all representative of what my abilities were as a developer so I wanted to make something better!

I'd been hearing a lot about [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org) and wanted to give it a try. I figured building a personal website would be a great way to take it for a test drive (which it was).

### Plans for the Future

This website will serve a few purposes over the next while:

1. **Personal Blog** : Somewhere for me to write about whatever interests me. I've always been interested in keeeping a blog and now I have the perfect platform to do so!

2. **Side Project** : The whole website is open-source and I plan to continue working on the site as time goes on.

3. **Portfolio** : Eventually I would like to add a projects section to the website that outlines what I'm working on, what my skillset is, etc.

4. **T.B.A** : 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
