## VR's Challenging Journey So Far

I've always been captivated by the idea of Virtual Reality. I grew up playing vibrant and engaging games through desaturated and flat screens, always wishing there was a way I could jump in and experience everything firsthand. Then, in august of 2012, the people behind Oculus released a kickstarter video that showed people a world in which those dreams could be real. 

6-7 years later, here we are; VR is more viable than ever before thanks to the advent of independent headsets like the [Oculus Go](https://www.oculus.com/go/?locale=en_US), more powerful PC's, mainstream gaming adoption ([PSVR](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/explore/playstation-vr/?emcid=pa-co-108223&utm_medium=Paid_Search&utm_campaign=&utm_source=&utm_term=pa-co-108223&utm_content=&gclid=CJ76zcS36uECFTG0ZQodnekIFQ)), innovation in the headset market, and [billions of investor dollars](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2014/03/25/facebook-buys-oculus-virtual-reality-gaming-startup-for-2-billion/#4d711e0a2498). That said, even with the immense progress we've made, we're still nowhere close to living in the world of Ernest Cline's "Ready Player One". 

[Headset sales are increasing reliably](https://www.statista.com/statistics/671403/global-virtual-reality-device-shipments-by-vendor/), but they're a drop in the bucket when compared to  [Xbox One](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/64602/xbox-one-sales-hit-41-million/index.html) or [PS4](https://www.statista.com/statistics/651576/global-ps4-console-unit-sales/) sales. The startup cost is still relatively high for VR use due to needing a [gaming PC](https://techguided.com/vr-ready-pc-builds/) in addition to a [headset](https://www.pcmag.com/article/342537/the-best-virtual-reality-vr-headsets). Due to the relatively small user base, it's financially risky to build software for the platform thus disincentivizing developers to risk their time and money on building for VR beyond small "experiment" projects.

Logically, looking at the VR market today, it wouldn't be reaching to conclude that either :

1. VR isn't ever going to be the game-changer people thought it would be
2. VR is going to take some more time to become the game-changer we thought it would be. 

All of this in mind, as a self-admitted VR lover with an optimistic viewpoint,  I think that there is still hope for VR to prove itself in the near future, more particularly, in 2019. 

## Hope for VR in 2019

There is one pivotal device that I'm willing to bet will make a significant splash in the VR market this year...

\***\*[**The Oculus Quest **](https://www.oculus.com/quest/?locale=en_US)**:\*\* a fully mobile, tether-less, 6 Degrees of Freedom (or 6DOF), VR headset by Oculus. 

I know that was a lot of jargon I just threw at you, and I'd like to breakdown exactly what the quest is and why I think it's such a huge deal for the state of VR in 2019. 

* **Fully Mobile / Tether-less :** This means that the headset isn't dependant on any other hardware or services to work. No expensive PC, no wires attached to the headset and on the floor for you to trip on, nothing. Just you, the Oculus Quest headset, some Oculus Touch Controllers, and some battery life, and you're good to play full VR games. **TLDR: You dont need a PC**
* **6 Degrees of Freedom (or 6DOF) :** In the early days of VR, VR headsets had 3 Degrees of Freedom (or 3DOF) representing the 3 axis that your headset will track, roll, yaw, and pitch: this essentially means the headset can only detect your head looking up and down, left and right, and side to side (or tilting). While 6DOF allows for the previously mentioned tracking as well as full 3D tracking of your hands and head (you can walk, crouch, and move your hands any way you like).  **\*\*This increases overall immersion and allows for much better accuracy and control of VR applications. While 6DOF is present on the Oculus RIft, HTC Vive, and Windows MR headsets, this is the first time it's available tether-less.**  TLDR: 6DOF essentially allows VR users to move freely, exactly as they would in real life.\*\*
* **VR Headset:** A headset that you use as your portal into virtual reality, It's comprised of a screen, two lenses, some straps, a mobile computer, and some remote controls for your hands. **TLDR: If you're reading this you know what a VR headset is**

Now that you know what the Oculus Quest is, let's get into why I think it could plunge VR gaming headset first (I'm sorry) into the mainstream in 2019, for good this time. 

### Affordable

The Oculus Quest starts at only $399 USD which I think is an absolute steal if Oculus delivers on all their promises. at $399 the quest is poised to take on consoles like the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One S, and PS4 Pro which are all priced right around the same.  

This takes high quality VR out of the [$1000 - $1500 USD ](https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/341963/the-best-computers-for-the-oculus-rift-vr-headset)range that you would currently pay for a VR gaming rig and puts it squarely in a much more attractive and attainable price range. 

### Quality Driven

Oculus has stated that it intends to insure that all content on the quest is [strictly vetted and reviewed internally before being added to the store.](https://uploadvr.com/quest-curation-rubin/) 

This extra step is taken to make sure that every single thing on the Quest's store works well and will put the system's best foot forward in every interaction possible. 

### Powerful

While the Oculus Quest simply wont be able to provide the same graphical fidelity as a $1500 PC setup, it still packs a hell of a punch with ports of killer PC VR games like Super Hot, Beat Saber, Job Simulator and Robo Recall. 

When you take into consideration Oculus's focus on quality content with this console porting over existing and intensive games to showcase the quests abilities on launch makes a tonne of sense and could attract gamer who otherwise wouldn't be interested. 

### Portable

You can take this thing anywhere, I mean it, Anywhere. To your friends house? sure! To your grandparents house for a family re-union? sure! To work to freak out some of your older co-workers? awesome!

This portability can contribute to the virality of the quest especially if there are a few good applications to get people in and having fun asap. 

## Things That Could Ruin VR in 2019

### Hardware / Software Issues

I would be ignorant not to mention the massive lead in both hardware and software needed to make the Oculus Quest possible. I would also be naive to not acknowledge that when new hardware comes out like this, especially first-generation technology \*cough\* apple-watch gen 1 battery \*cough\* there tends to be some pretty substantial issues with the hardware. 

### Lack of Product Knowledge / Understanding

Overall, VR has not been a very well understood market. People tend to know what VR is, but more often than not that's where their understanding ends. People tend to think of VR as PSVR or google cardboard, which, at best, are sub optimal 3DOF experiences, that aren't representative of today's excellent VR tech. 

Overall, this is on the companies producing these headsets to better educate consumers on what high quality VR can look like. 

### Facebook being Facebook

Facebook, being the owner of Oculus, and more particularly, Mark Zuckerburg seemingly being the new face of Oculus (introduced the last few Oculus Developer Conferences) may not be the best look for Oculus right now. 

Facebook has been heavily under fire the last year or so regarding privacy scandals and possible breaches of privacy law. Potential users may take issue with this and in-turn be turned off by the Oculus Quest. 

### Everything else

The odds are definitely not stacked in Facebook and Oculus's favour here. VR has has had problems climbing all of the hurdles I just mentioned. For the Oculus Quest to topple them all and come on top as a commercially viable, fully viable VR headset would be unprecedented and huge win for Oculus and for every other name in VR. 

However, even with all of Facebook's resources, I'm not sure if Oculus will be able to pull this off. Only time will tell and until them I'm still an optimistic VR fanboy.
