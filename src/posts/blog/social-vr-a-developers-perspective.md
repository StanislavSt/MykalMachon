## Introduction

I've always been captivated by the idea of Virtual Reality. I grew up playing vibrant and engaging games through desaturated and flat screens, always wishing there was a way I could jump in and experience everything firsthand. Then, in august of 2012, the people behind Oculus released a kickstarter video that showed people a world in which those dreams could be real. 

6-7 years later, here we are; VR is more viable than ever before thanks to the advent of independent headsets like the [Oculus Go](https://www.oculus.com/go/?locale=en_US), more powerful PC's, mainstream gaming adoption ([PSVR](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/explore/playstation-vr/?emcid=pa-co-108223&utm_medium=Paid_Search&utm_campaign=&utm_source=&utm_term=pa-co-108223&utm_content=&gclid=CJ76zcS36uECFTG0ZQodnekIFQ)), innovation in the headset market, and [billions of investor dollars](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2014/03/25/facebook-buys-oculus-virtual-reality-gaming-startup-for-2-billion/#4d711e0a2498). That said, even with the immense progress we've made, we're still nowhere close to living in the world of Ernest Cline's "Ready Player One". 

[Headset sales are increasing reliably](https://www.statista.com/statistics/671403/global-virtual-reality-device-shipments-by-vendor/), but they're a drop in the bucket when compared to  [Xbox One](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/64602/xbox-one-sales-hit-41-million/index.html) or [PS4](https://www.statista.com/statistics/651576/global-ps4-console-unit-sales/) sales. The startup cost is still relatively high due to needing a [gaming PC](https://techguided.com/vr-ready-pc-builds/) in addition to a [headset](https://www.pcmag.com/article/342537/the-best-virtual-reality-vr-headsets). Due to the relatively small user base, it's financially risky to build software for the platform and developers are deincentivized to do so.

Honestly, if you look at the market for what it is today, the future of VR looks pretty bleak. However, I think there is still a glimmer of hope for the future of VR. The industry calls them independent 6DOF headsets, the best example being the Oculus Quest.
