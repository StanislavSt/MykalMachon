This past weekend, I participated in ZEIT's first ever Hackathon. It was a  48 hour event that was centred around building an integration for ZEIT's "now" server-less hosting platform.  I had never worked with Now before, but I love some of ZEIT's other products, Next.js (a server side rendered React.js framework) and Hyper.js (an electron-based Command Line Interface App) so I figured this would be a good opportunity to learn about Now through building a little project with it. 

This post is going to go over what I built, what I learned, and what some takeaways for my next Hackathon.
