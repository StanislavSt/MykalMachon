Due to my previous blog post, and some conversations on twitter about Battlesnake, I was offered the opportunity to help with [a Battlensake story in the Victoria news!](https://www.vicnews.com/news/battlesnake-a-programing-competition-creating-community/)

I had a tonne of fun talking with (more like rambling at) the stories author Kendra about why I love battlesnake and the community around it.
