# Hi! I'm Mykal <span role="img" aria-label="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>

I'm a university student and software engineer from British Columbia, Canada. When I'm not studying, I'm either working at [Aprario Group](https://aprario.com), a community focused investment company, or tinkering with one of my many [side projects.](https://github.com/mykalmachon)

Im currently completing a Bachelor in Computer Information Sciences with a focus in Software Development at the [University of the Fraser Valley](https://ufv.ca). I'm in my third year and plan to complete my degree by the summer of 2020.

I'm also available for hire to work individually on small software projects or in teams as needed. I specialize in engineering web applications that solve business needs. In the past I've worked on :

- Financial dashboards
- Automated reporting systems
- System integrations
- Company websites

If you'd like to work with me on a project feel free to reach out through my contact page or through social media (a Twitter DM will probably the best way to do this)
