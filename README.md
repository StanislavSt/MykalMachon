### Mykal Machon's Personal Website

This is my personal website! I'm planning for the site to include the following :

1. **My Work:** Things I've worked on in the past that I'm proud of!
2. **My Projects**: Current projects I'm toying with on the side ( see NeedToDo & OpenInbox )
3. **Blog Posts**: _Possibly?_ I've always wanted to have a regular writing schedule; if anything to keep my writing sharp and to keep me learning new things.

In addition to this I might add a few little fun tweaks here and there depending on how I'm feeling. 

### Planned Tech Stack

- Gatsby.js + Netlify to provide a static-site that is re-built upon new content being pushed
- Contentful / CMS to host the content itself and to allow for the seperated interface for data.
